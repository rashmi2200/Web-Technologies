      Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 â€“ June 19, 1956) was an American
      businessman who served as the chairman and CEO of IBM.[1][2] He oversaw
      the company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson
      developed IBM's management style and corporate culture from John Henry
      Patterson's training at NCR.[3] He turned the company into a highly
      effective selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating
      machines. A leading self-made industrialist,[4] he was one of the richest
      men of his time and was called the world's greatest salesman when he died
      in 1956.
